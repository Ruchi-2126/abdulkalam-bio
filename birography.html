    <h3 id="career">Career</h3>
    <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam’s career was a testament to his unwavering dedication to science, technology, and national service. Born in 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, into a humble family, Kalam rose from modest beginnings to become one of India’s most respected scientists. He began his professional journey at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), working on a hovercraft project, but his passion for aerospace engineering found its true purpose at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). As the project director of India’s first indigenously developed Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III), he was instrumental in successfully launching the Rohini satellite into orbit in 1980, marking a major milestone in India's space program. This achievement placed India among a select group of nations with space launch capabilities. After his success at ISRO, Kalam returned to DRDO, where he led the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), resulting in the development of strategic missiles like Agni, Prithvi, Trishul, and Akash. These innovations earned him the nickname “Missile Man of India” and solidified his reputation as a visionary leader in defense and aerospace technology. His career spanned over four decades of groundbreaking contributions that empowered India in the fields of science, space exploration, and national security. His early work involved developing India's first indigenous hovercraft, but his major breakthrough came when he joined ISRO, where he was the project director of India’s first satellite launch vehicle, SLV-3. Under his leadership, SLV-3 successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit in 1980, marking a historic milestone in India's space journey. He later played a pivotal role in developing ballistic missile technology, which earned him the title "Missile Man of India."

    <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
    <p>Throughout his life, Dr. Kalam held a singular, unwavering goal: to transform India into a strong, self-reliant, and developed nation. He believed that this transformation could be achieved through a combination of technological innovation, education, and empowered youth. One of his most ambitious visions was presented in his book India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium, where he laid out a comprehensive plan to elevate India from a developing to a developed country by the year 2020. Dr. Kalam believed in igniting young minds and often said that the youth are the most powerful resource any nation has. He consistently encouraged students to dream big, think creatively, and work hard to contribute to the nation’s progress. Even during his tenure as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007, he remained a people’s president, traveling across the country, meeting students, and discussing how they could shape the future. His goal wasn’t just economic development, but also building a moral, inclusive, and technologically advanced society.Dr. Kalam believed in igniting young minds and often said that the youth are the most powerful resource any nation has.
